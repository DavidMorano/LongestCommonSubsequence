Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) determination

This code base was an experiement in finding the Longest Common Subsequence
in a set of strings.  The set of strings can hold as many strings as desired
and also can consist of strings of different lengths.

Data (files of strinfs) are stored in the 'data' subdirectory.
More data (miscellaneous data) is in the 'data_misc' subdirectory.

Algorithmic attempts are each in their own subdirectory as follows:

directory
-----------------------------------------

greedy
local1
local2
random1
random2
random3
ex_dave1
ex_dave2


Note: The |random3| should be the best algorithm.
